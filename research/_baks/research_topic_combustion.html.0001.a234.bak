                                  Kinetics</strong> Use of shock tube and flat
                                  flame burner techniques enables controlled
                                  study of chemical reactions relevant to combustion.
                                  Current research topics range from fundamental
                                  studies of chemical reactions that produce
                                  or remove nitrogen oxides (NOx) in combustion
                                  systems, to studies of specific hydrocarbon
                                  oxidation and pyrolysis reactions critical
                                  to detailed modeling of natural gas combustion
                                  and combustion of nitrogen-based propellants.
                                  One study, involving the kinetics of methyl
                                  radicals, an important intermediate species
                                  in combustion of natural gas, is intended to
                                  improve understanding of the combustion process
                                  involving hydrocarbon fuels. In another study
                                  we are using a new type of chemical reactor,
                                  which combines shock-wave heating tube and
                                  laser-photolysis concepts, for fundamental
                                  investigations of reaction kinetics. Finally,
                                  we have recently initiated a new program to
                                  study combustion chemistry at very high pressures,
                                  which is relevant to proposed advanced combustion
                                  systems. In each of these research areas, the
                                  development and application of modern spectroscopic
                                  diagnostic techniques plays a significant role.

                                    Coal Combustion and Gasification</strong> Research
                                  efforts in this area are intended to extend
                                  our understanding of the chemical and physical
                                  processes that describe the behaviors of coal
                                  char particles at the temperatures and pressures
                                  of industrial importance. The objective of
                                  one study is to provide the information needed
                                  to allow the prediction of the effects of coal
                                  properties on char particle burning rates.
                                  Another study is concerned with char particle
                                  fragmentation and its effect on unburned carbon
                                  during pulverized coal combustion and gasification.
                                  Another is concerned with characterizing the
                                  inhibition effects of CO on the gasification
                                  of coal chars in CO2 environments. Coals ranging
                                  in rank from lignite to low-volatile bituminous
                                  are employed in the studies. Because coal is
                                  so heterogeneous, we also employ synthetic
                                  chars having known densities, porosities, and
                                  mineral loadings to aid in data interpretation
                                  and to provide mechanistic insight. We use
                                  entrained flow reactors and thermogravimetric
                                  analyzers to observe coal combustion and gasification
                                  phenomena over wide ranges of temperature,
                                  composition, and pressure. A study concerned
                                  with pyrite combustion is also underway. The
                                  objective of this study is to characterize
                                  the various mechanisms of intraparticle mass
                                  transfer and chemical reaction that control
                                  overall pyrite conversion rates during coal
                                  combustion. Pyrite particles are found in coal
                                  and the conversion of pyrite particles to non-adhesive
                                  magnetite particles is key in reducing slag
                                  formation in coal-fired combustors. An important
                                  aspect of our work is the development of engineering
                                  models that can be applied to large scale,
                                  practical coal combustors and gasifiers. The
                                  models will yield accurate characterization
                                  of char particle temperatures and burning rates
                                  over wide ranges of gas temperatures, pressures,
                                  and compositions, and hence, will permit the
                                  accurate prediction of mass loss rates, pollutant
                                  and slag formation rates, and heat transfer
                                  rates in industrial coal-fired devices.

                                    we are investigating the interaction between
                                    turbulence and chemical reaction rates in
                                    combustion gases. Optical diagnostic techniques
                                    are employed to make non-intrusive measurements
                                    of species concentration and velocity in
                                    well-defined turbulent reacting flows. These
                                    measurements are used to determine local
                                    reaction rates in the flow which, in turn,
                                    are used to develop phenomenological models
                                    for turbulent combustion. Jets in cross-flow
                                    are currently under investigation for a range
                                    of conditions and heat release. Our latest
                                    approaches involve the simultaneous use of
                                    Planar Laser-Induced Fluorescence (PLIF)
                                    for measurements of scalars, with Particle
                                    Image Velocimetry (PIV) for measurement of
                                    the velocity field.

                                    Mixing and Combustion</strong> The objective
                                    of this program is to understand the differences
                                    between supersonic and subsonic mixing and
                                    its effect upon combustion. A supersonic
                                    shear layer facility has been built for this
                                    purpose with high stagnation temperature
                                    and pressure capability. Advanced diagnostic
                                    techniques are being used to study the instantaneous
                                    scalar, velocity and reaction fields. These
                                    measurements reveal information about mixing,
                                    scalar transport and burning mechanisms when
                                    compressibility is important. The work proceeds
                                    in parallel with numerical simulation of
                                    the same flows. A related effort involves
                                    techniques to achieve mixing and combustion
                                    enhancements under compressible conditions. <a href="http://www-htgl.stanford.edu/mungal/ssc/">Supersonic
